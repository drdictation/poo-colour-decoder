The shades you see come from a mix of what you eat, how your body digests food, and the bile your liver produces. For example, green veggies like spinach or foods with green coloring can give your stool a greenish tint, while carrots or sweet potatoes might add a hint of orange. Darker stools often come from foods rich in iron or even chocolate, which add deep brown or black hues. Even the speed your digestive system processes food can change the color—faster movement can keep bile green, leading to greener stool. So next time you visit the bathroom, remember: your stool’s color is a little daily masterpiece reflecting your body’s vibrant workings!</p><p><em>AI-generated.
