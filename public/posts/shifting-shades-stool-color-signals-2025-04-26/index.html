This is what “Shifting Shades: Stool Color Signals” is all about! While brown is the most common color due to bile and digestive juices mixing with food, different hues can pop up based on what you eat or how your body is processing things. For example, bright green stool might mean you’ve been munching on lots of leafy greens or that food moved a bit too quickly through your intestines. On the other hand, foods like beets or artificial colorings can turn things reddish or purple. Even the simple addition of certain spices or drinks can make a surprising splash in your toilet bowl palette. It’s like a daily canvas reflecting your diet and digestion!</p><p><em>AI-generated.
