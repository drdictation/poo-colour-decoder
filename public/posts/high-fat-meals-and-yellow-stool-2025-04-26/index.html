    <h1>High-Fat Meals And Yellow Stool</h1>
    <p class="archive-date">Apr 26, 2025</p>
    <p>Did you know that your stool can turn a surprising shade of yellow after indulging in high-fat meals? It&rsquo;s a little color adventure that happens because of bile, which is a digestive fluid produced by your liver. When you munch on fatty foods like that delicious cheesy pizza or a yummy ice cream sundae, your body goes into overdrive, producing more bile to break down all that fat. If the fat doesn’t get fully absorbed, it can whisk the bile through your intestines quicker than usual, adding a sunny yellow hue to your stool. So next time you notice a little burst of sunshine in the toilet bowl, you might just have those tempting, fat-packed treats to thank!</p>
