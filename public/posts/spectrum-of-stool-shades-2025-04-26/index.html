    <h1>Spectrum of Stool Shades</h1>
    <p class="archive-date">Apr 26, 2025</p>
    <p>Did you know that the shades of your stool can paint quite the colorful story? The “spectrum of stool shades” ranges from various tones of brown to unexpected hues like green, yellow, or even black! Most stools are brown because of a pigment called bilirubin, made when your body breaks down old red blood cells. But sometimes, what you eat or how fast food moves through your digestive system can change those colors. Greens might pop up after munching on leafy greens or taking iron supplements, while yellowish stools can hint at extra fat passing through. Even darker colors like black could come from certain foods or drinks like black licorice or blueberries. It’s like your digestive system’s way of showcasing its colorful adventures!</p>
