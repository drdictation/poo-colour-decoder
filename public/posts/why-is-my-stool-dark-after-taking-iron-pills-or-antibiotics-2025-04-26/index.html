This color change is actually quite common and happens because iron supplements introduce extra iron into your digestive system. When iron mixes with digestive fluids, it creates a darker pigment, giving your stool a deep, sometimes tar-like appearance. Similarly, some antibiotics can alter your gut bacteria or interact with meals, which might also affect stool color. It’s a harmless side effect showing how what you swallow can directly influence what comes out! So next time your stool looks like a midnight snack after popping those pills, it’s just your body’s colorful response to your treatment journey. Pretty cool, right?</p><p><em>AI-generated.
