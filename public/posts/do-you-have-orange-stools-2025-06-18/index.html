        <h1 id="do-you-have-orange-stools">Do you have orange stools?</h1>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Orange stools can be caused by a variety of factors, including diet, medication, or underlying health conditions. While often harmless, persistent orange stools should prompt a consultation with a healthcare provider to rule out serious issues.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>If you <strong>do have orange stools</strong>, it’s natural to wonder what this unusual color might mean for your health. Orange stool discoloration is a symptom that can be triggered by several causes, ranging from what you eat to how your digestive system is functioning. Understanding why stools turn orange can help you decide when this change is simply a temporary anomaly or a signal to seek medical advice.</p>
<h2 id="key-causes">Key Causes</h2>
<p>Here we explore the most common reasons you might <strong>have orange stools</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="dietary-influences">Dietary Influences</h3>
<p>One of the leading and most benign causes of orange stools is what you eat. Foods rich in <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/beta-carotene">beta-carotene</a> (like carrots, sweet potatoes, and pumpkins) contain pigments that can alter stool color. Artificial food colorings found in candies, drinks, or processed foods might also temporarily tint your stools orange.</p>
<h3 id="digestive-transit-time-changes">Digestive Transit Time Changes</h3>
<p>When stool moves too quickly through the intestines—such as with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diarrhea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352241">diarrhea</a>—the bile pigments that normally give stool its brown color don’t have enough time to break down fully. This can result in orange or <a href="../why-is-my-poo-yellow-7-common-causes-2025-04-28">yellowish stools</a>.</p>
<h3 id="medication-and-supplements">Medication and Supplements</h3>
<p>Certain medications, including <a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1269-5456/aluminum-hydroxide-oral/aluminum-hydroxide-oral/details">antacids containing aluminum hydroxide</a>, or supplements such as beta-carotene and some antibiotics, can cause changes in stool coloration. If you recently started a new medication and notice orange stools, it might be related.</p>
<h3 id="liver-and-gallbladder-conditions">Liver and Gallbladder Conditions</h3>
<p>Problems with bile production or flow, such as <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15272-bile-duct-obstruction">bile duct obstruction</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gallstones/symptoms-causes/syc-20354214">gallstones</a>, or <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/liverdiseases.html">liver disease</a>, can affect stool color. Bile is normally a greenish fluid that becomes brown when digested; disruptions here can cause orange or <a href="../why-is-my-poo-pale-common-causes-2025-04-29">pale stools</a>. If you <strong>have orange stools</strong> accompanied by other symptoms like <a href="https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/jaundice-know-the-signs">jaundice</a>, abdominal pain, or dark urine, seek medical advice promptly.</p>
<h3 id="pancreatic-issues">Pancreatic Issues</h3>
<p>The pancreas plays a role in producing digestive enzymes. Conditions like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20360227">pancreatitis</a> or <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreatic-cancer.html">pancreatic cancer</a> can influence digestion and impact stool color, potentially causing orange stools among other signs.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-seek-help">When to Seek Help</h2>
<p>While orange stools are often harmless and temporary, there are important warning signs to watch for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persistent stool discoloration lasting more than a few days.</li>
<li>Accompanying symptoms such as <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/abdominal-pain">abdominal pain</a>, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, or fatigue.</li>
<li>Signs of jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes).</li>
<li><a href="../red-stool-vs-blood-in-stool-whats-the-difference-2025-05-27">Blood in stool</a> or <a href="../black-or-tarry-stool-when-to-worry-2025-05-30">black, tarry stools</a>.</li>
<li>Changes in bowel habits lasting over two weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you <strong>do have orange stools</strong> along with these symptoms, make an appointment with your healthcare provider to undergo appropriate evaluation and testing.</p>
