Did you know that your stool’s color can be like a little daily report from your digestive system? Normally, it’s brown thanks to a pigment called bilirubin, which comes from the breakdown of old red blood cells. But sometimes, what you eat or take can change this color! For example, eating lots of beets can turn your stool reddish, while foods with spinach or iron supplements might give it a greenish tint. Even medications like some antibiotics or antacids can cause surprising color shifts. Infections can also make stool look different, often causing yellow or pale stools. So, your stool’s color is actually a vibrant mix of your diet, medications, and how your body’s working—a colorful little clue to how things are going inside!
