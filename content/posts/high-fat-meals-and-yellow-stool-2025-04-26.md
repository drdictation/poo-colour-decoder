Did you know that your stool can turn a surprising shade of yellow after indulging in high-fat meals? It's a little color adventure that happens because of bile, which is a digestive fluid produced by your liver. When you munch on fatty foods like that delicious cheesy pizza or a yummy ice cream sundae, your body goes into overdrive, producing more bile to break down all that fat. If the fat doesnâ€™t get fully absorbed, it can whisk the bile through your intestines quicker than usual, adding a sunny [yellow hue](../why-is-my-poo-yellow-7-common-causes-2025-04-28) to your stool. So next time you notice a little burst of sunshine in the toilet bowl, you might just have those tempting, fat-packed treats to thank!
