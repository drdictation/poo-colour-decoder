Did you know that the colors of your poop can tell a fascinating story about what’s happening inside your gut? That’s the idea behind “Rainbow Poops: Gut Clues Decoded”! From the classic brown to shades of green, yellow, black, and even red, each color offers clues about digestion and diet. For example, green poop often shows up when food moves quickly through your intestines or when you’ve eaten lots of leafy greens. Yellow hues can hint at how fat is being processed, while black or red might point to pigments from certain foods like berries or beets. Though it sounds funny, your poop’s palette can be a colorful way to learn how your body is working—and sometimes what you’ve been eating! It’s like nature’s own mood ring, but for your gut.
