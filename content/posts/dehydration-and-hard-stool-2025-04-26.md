Did you know that dehydration can not only make your stool hard but also change its color? When you don’t drink enough water, your body pulls extra fluids from your waste before it's ready to leave your body. This makes your poop harder and often darker—think deep brown or even blackish! On the flip side, if you’re super hydrated, your stool tends to be softer and lighter brown, signaling a well-watered digestive journey. Color changes in your stool are like little mood rings for your tummy, giving you clues about what’s happening inside. So next time you notice a color shift, it might just be your body’s colorful way of saying, “Hey, maybe sip some water!” Fun, right?
