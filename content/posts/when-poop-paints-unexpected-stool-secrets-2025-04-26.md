Did you know that your poop can come in a rainbow of colors, each telling a little story about what’s happening inside your digestive system? For example, green stool might pop up if you’ve been munching on lots of leafy greens or if food is moving quickly through your intestines. Yellow poop can hint at extra fat, often due to how your body digests food. And that surprising black stool? Sometimes it’s from certain foods or supplements, but it can also show your stomach’s unique chemistry at work. Even colorful medications, like iron pills, can leave their mark. So, in a way, your poop is like a tiny artist’s palette, painting a vivid picture each day of your body’s busy backstage processes!
