Did you know that your poop can come in a rainbow of colors, and each shade tells a little story about what’s happening inside your body? Normally, stool is brown because of bile and digested food, but sometimes it can surprise you! Green poop might mean your food moved through your intestines faster than usual, or you’ve eaten lots of leafy greens. Yellow poop can hint at extra fat, often from eating rich, buttery treats. Even weird colors like red or black can pop up, usually from harmless foods like beets or black licorice. While these color changes are often just nature’s colorful way of showing what you’ve eaten, they remind us how our body is a fascinating, ever-changing system working hard every day!
