# What happens to the colour of my poo when I take antibiotics

**TL;DR**: Taking antibiotics can change the colour of your poo, often making it lighter, green, or even black due to shifts in gut bacteria and bile pigment processing. Most changes are harmless and temporary, but persistent or severe colour alterations warrant medical advice.

## Overview

Understanding *what happens to the colour of my poo when I take antibiotics* is important for maintaining digestive health and peace of mind during treatment. Antibiotics, while essential for fighting bacterial infections, can disrupt the normal balance of gut flora and affect how your digestive system processes bile pigments—both of which influence stool colour. Noticing changes in your poo is common and usually not serious, but knowing the reasons behind these changes can help you manage your health better.

## Key Causes

### Disruption of Gut Bacteria

Antibiotics work by killing harmful bacteria, but they also affect beneficial bacteria residing in your intestines. This disruption can reduce the population of microbes responsible for breaking down bile pigments and other waste products, leading to changes in stool colour.

- **Light or Pale Stool**: Antibiotics can slow down bile pigment processing, causing lighter or clay-coloured poo.
- **Green Stool**: When food passes too quickly through the intestine due to imbalance, bile doesn’t have time to fully break down, resulting in greenish stool.

### Altered Bile Flow and Digestion

Bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, gives stool its characteristic brown colour through the breakdown of bilirubin. Antibiotics may indirectly affect bile secretion or intestinal motility.

- Some antibiotics may cause changes in liver enzyme activity or irritate the digestive system.
- The reduced bile pigment conversion can cause paler stools during antibiotic treatment.

### Side Effects of Specific Antibiotics

Certain types of antibiotics are more commonly associated with stool colour changes:

- **Metronidazole and Tinidazole**: May cause dark or black stools.
- **Iron-containing antibiotics or supplements** taken alongside antibiotics can darken stool.
- **Clindamycin and broad-spectrum antibiotics** often cause diarrhoea, impacting stool colour and consistency.

### Gastrointestinal Side Effects

Antibiotics can sometimes cause diarrhea, which changes stool colour and texture abruptly:

- Loose stools may appear yellow or green.
- Rapid transit time decreases bile breakdown, affecting colour.

## When to Seek Help

While poo colour changes during antibiotic use are often harmless, there are times when medical consultation is warranted:

- **Black, tarry stools** lasting more than a day may indicate bleeding in the upper GI tract.
- **Persistent pale or clay-coloured stools** could signal liver or bile duct problems.
- **Accompanying symptoms** such as severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, or dehydration.
- If you develop **severe diarrhoea** or suspect *Clostridioides difficile* infection (CDI), especially after prolonged antibiotic use, seek prompt medical care.
- Any sudden, unexplained changes in bowel habits lasting beyond your antibiotic course.
