# Red Stool vs. Blood in Stool: What’s the Difference?

**TL;DR:**  
Red stool and blood in stool can look similar but have different causes and implications. While red stool may result from harmless dietary factors, blood in stool often signals bleeding within the gastrointestinal tract and requires medical evaluation. Understanding the difference is crucial for timely treatment and peace of mind.

## Overview

Red stool vs. blood in stool is a common concern for many people noticing unusual changes in bowel movements. While both conditions involve a reddish appearance, the underlying causes differ considerably. This article explores the key differences, helping you understand when red stool is harmless and when blood in stool may signify a serious health issue.

## Key Causes

### Red Stool Causes

Red stool often results from external or less serious factors. Some common causes include:

- **Dietary Factors:** Eating [beetroot](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/beets-benefits), tomatoes, red gelatin, or foods with artificial red coloring can temporarily cause red stool without any bleeding.
- **Medications and Supplements:** Certain medications like [rifampin](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682403.html), or [iron supplements](https://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/23458-iron-supplements), may alter stool color.
- **Food Coloring:** Red dyes found in candies, drinks, or processed foods can tint stool red.
- **Hemorrhoids:** Minor bleeding from [hemorrhoids](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemorrhoids/symptoms-causes/syc-20360268) can occasionally cause reddish streaks in the stool, but if bleeding is mild, it might be mistaken for red stool instead of blood.

### Blood in Stool Causes

Blood in stool indicates bleeding somewhere along the digestive tract. Causes include:

- **Hemorrhoids:** Swollen blood vessels in the rectum or anus that bleed easily during bowel movements.
- **Anal Fissures:** Small tears in the lining of the anus causing [bright red bleeding](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/anal-fissure).
- **Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis:** [Diverticular disease](https://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10352-diverticulosis-and-diverticulitis) can lead to bleeding or inflammation of pouches in the colon wall.
- **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD):** Chronic inflammation from [Crohn’s disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304) or [ulcerative colitis](https://www.webmd.com/ibd-crohns-disease/ulcerative-colitis/what-is-ulcerative-colitis) can cause bloody diarrhea.
- **Infections:** Bacterial infections like [E. coli](https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/index.html) or [Shigella](https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/index.html) may cause inflammation and bleeding.
- **Polyps and Colon Cancer:** [Colorectal polyps](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-polyps/symptoms-causes/syc-20352875) or [colon cancer](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/colon-rectal-cancer.html) can bleed; early detection is critical.
- **Gastrointestinal Ulcers:** [Stomach ulcers](https://www.healthline.com/health/stomach-ulcer) or duodenal ulcers may cause darker or tarry stool but sometimes red blood appears if bleeding is brisk and lower in the tract.

## When to Seek Help

Understanding when red stool vs. blood in stool needs medical attention can make a crucial difference:

- **Seek Medical Help Immediately If:**
  - You pass large amounts of bright red blood.
  - You experience dizziness, weakness, or rapid heartbeat.

  - You have a [family history of colorectal cancer](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/basic_info/risk_factors.htm) or polyps.

- **See a Doctor Within a Few Days If:**
  - You notice red stool but are unsure if it’s caused by diet or bleeding.
  - You have minor bleeding with no obvious cause.
  - Symptoms persist or worsen over time.

- **When It May Be Harmless:**
