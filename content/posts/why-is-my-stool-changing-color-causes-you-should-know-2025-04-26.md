Have you ever noticed your stool changing color and wondered why? It turns out, stool color can tell quite the story about what’s going on inside your digestive system! Most commonly, brown stool is thanks to bile and the natural breakdown of food, but when colors shift, it can be fascinating to explore. For example, green stool might mean you’ve been munching on lots of leafy veggies or that food moved through your intestines a bit faster than usual. Black or very dark stool can come from certain foods like blueberries or iron supplements. On the lighter side, pale or clay-colored stool might occur when bile isn’t reaching the intestines properly. These colorful changes are usually normal and reflect what you eat or how your digestive system is working—not just random surprises!
