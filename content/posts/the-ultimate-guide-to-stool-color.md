## The Stool Color Chart: A Visual Guide

### Brown: The Gold Standard
Most of the time, stool is brown. This is due to the presence of bile, a fluid produced by your liver to digest fats. As bile travels through your digestive system, it changes from green to brown. A consistent brown color is a good sign of a healthy digestive tract.

### Green: The Speedy Stool
Green stool is one of the most common color changes. It often means that food is moving through your intestines too quickly (a condition known as rapid transit), and the green bile doesn't have enough time to break down and turn brown. It can also be caused by eating lots of leafy greens or certain medications.

### Yellow: The Greasy Indicator
Yellow, greasy, or foul-smelling stool often indicates an excess of fat. This can be due to a high-fat meal or a malabsorption disorder where your body isn't digesting fat properly. Conditions affecting the pancreas or gallbladder are often linked to yellow stool.

### Black: The Alarm Bell
Black stool can be harmless, often caused by iron supplements or black licorice. However, it can also be a serious sign of bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract (like the stomach or esophagus). This digested blood turns black and tarry (a condition called melena) and always warrants a conversation with a doctor.

### Red: A Case of Diet or Bleeding
Seeing red in the toilet can be frightening. Often, it's caused by red-colored foods like beets, cranberries, or tomato soup. However, it can also be a sign of bleeding in the lower digestive tract, such as from hemorrhoids or more serious conditions. It's crucial to know how to tell the difference.

### Pale, White, or Clay-Colored: The Bile Blocker
If your stool is pale, white, or the color of clay, it usually means that bile is not reaching your stool. This can be due to a bile duct obstruction caused by gallstones, liver problems, or other conditions. This symptom should be taken seriously.

### Orange: The Beta-Carotene Clue
Orange stool is less common but is often caused by eating a lot of beta-carotene-rich foods, such as carrots, sweet potatoes, and squash. It can also be caused by certain medications or issues with bile flow.
