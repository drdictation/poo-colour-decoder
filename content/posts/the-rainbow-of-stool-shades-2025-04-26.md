Here’s a quirky little fact about the “Rainbow of Stool Shades”! Did you know that stool comes in a whole spectrum of colors, much like a rainbow? From golden brown to green, even shades of yellow or black, your stool’s color can be influenced by what you eat, how fast your digestive system is working, and the natural pigments in your body. For example, eating a lot of leafy greens might give your stool a greenish tint, while foods rich in iron can darken it. The golden brown color most people see is thanks to bile— a digestive juice your liver makes. So, your stool is like a colorful signal, quietly showing how your body is processing all the delicious (and not-so-delicious) things you eat!
