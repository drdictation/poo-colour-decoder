Did you know that the color of your stool can reveal some surprising secrets about what’s going on inside your body? Most stools are brown due to a pigment called bilirubin, which comes from the breakdown of red blood cells. But sometimes, your stool can take on different hues! For example, green stool might show up if food moves too quickly through your intestines, or if you’ve been eating lots of leafy greens. On the other hand, black stool can happen if you’ve recently enjoyed some dark-colored foods like black licorice or blueberries. Even yellow stool can appear, often linked to how your body is digesting fats. These colorful clues are nature’s way of giving you little hints about your digestion and diet – pretty cool, right?
