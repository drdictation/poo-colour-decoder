# Is brown the only normal color of poo?

**TL;DR**: Brown is the most common and generally normal color of poo due to bile and digestive processes. However, poo can appear in various colors depending on [diet](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-eat-healthy), [health conditions](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/ss/slideshow-digestive-diseases-overview), or [medications](https://medlineplus.gov/medicines.html). Understanding these variations can help you monitor your digestive health effectively.

## Overview

Is brown the only normal color of poo? While brown stool is the typical and healthy color for most people, poo can actually come in a variety of shades ranging from green and yellow to black or even red. These color differences often reflect what you eat or underlying health issues. This blog post will explore the meaning behind different poo colors and when you should be concerned.

## Key Causes

### Why is poo usually brown?

Brown is the normal color of poo primarily because of [bile](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/bile), a digestive fluid produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile starts greenish but changes color as it breaks down in the intestines, turning stool various shades of brown. The pigments called stercobilin are responsible for this coloration. When digestion proceeds normally, brown stool indicates healthy bowel function.

### Green poo: What does it mean?

[Green stool](https://www.healthline.com/health/green-poop) is often due to eating leafy greens, green food coloring, or [iron supplements](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/iron-supplement-oral-route/description/drg-20070148). It can also occur when food passes too quickly through the intestines, such as in [diarrhea](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/infants.html), preventing bile from fully breaking down. In most cases, green poo is harmless, but persistent green stools might warrant medical advice.

### Yellow or greasy poo: Should you worry?

[Yellow or greasy stools](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/y/yellow-stool.html) can indicate [malabsorption](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/diseases-conditions/malabsorption) of fats, often linked to conditions like [celiac disease](https://www.cdc.gov/dotw/celiac-disease/index.html), [pancreatitis](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/pancreatitis), or [gallbladder problems](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/picture-of-the-gallbladder). These stools might appear loose, foul-smelling, and look oily. If you notice this color change consistently along with other symptoms like [weight loss](https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/unexplained-weight-loss/basics/definition/sym-20050700) or abdominal pain, consult your healthcare provider.

### Black or red stools: Signs of bleeding?

[Black stools](https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/black-tar-like-stools/basics/causes/sym-20050713) can result from iron supplements or certain foods but may also indicate [bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract](https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/digestive-disorders/gastrointestinal-bleeding/overview-of-gastrointestinal-bleeding). [Red stools](https://www.medicinenet.com/what_does_bright_red_blood_in_your_stool_mean/article.htm) might be caused by red-colored foods or [lower gastrointestinal bleeding](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459178/), such as from [hemorrhoids](https://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15158-hemorrhoids) or [diverticulitis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diverticulitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20371758). Both black and red stools warrant prompt medical evaluation if unexplained.

### Pale or clay-colored poo: What does it suggest?

[Pale or clay-colored poop](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/14594-pale-stool) can signify a lack of bile reaching the intestines, often caused by [bile duct obstruction](https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/liver-and-gallbladder-disorders/manifestations-of-liver-disease/bile-duct-obstruction) or [liver disease](https://www.healthline.com/health/liver-disease). Because bile pigments give stool its brown color, a reduction leads to pale stool. If this color persists, itâ€™s important to seek medical assessment.

## When to Seek Help

While variations in poo color are often harmless and related to diet, certain signs indicate the need for prompt medical attention:

- Stool that is black, tarry, or contains visible blood without an obvious dietary cause.
- Persistent yellow, greasy stools associated with [weight loss](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cervical-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/signs-symptoms.html) or [fatigue](https://www.healthline.com/health/fatigue).
- Pale or clay-colored stools lasting more than a day or two.
- Accompaniment of symptoms such as [abdominal pain](https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/abdominal-pain/basics/causes/sym-20050728), [fever](https://www.cdc.gov/fever/index.html), or diarrhea lasting over several days.
- Changes in [bowel habits](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/changes-in-bowel-habits) that are unexplained or prolonged.

If you observe these warning signs, consulting a healthcare professional can help diagnose and treat any underlying issues.
