Did you know your stool comes in a rainbow of colors, each telling a little story about what’s happening inside your digestive system? Shades of brown are the most common, thanks to bile—a greenish fluid your liver produces that changes color as it journeys through your intestines. Sometimes, you might spot green stools, often after gobbling down lots of leafy greens or something speeding through your gut. Yellowish stool can hint at extra fat, while black or very dark brown might be from certain foods like black licorice or blueberries. Bright red can come from beets or a splash of tomato sauce. Even pale or clay-colored stools pop up occasionally, often linked to bile flow changes. So next time you notice a new hue, think of it as your body’s colorful way of sharing its digestive tale!
