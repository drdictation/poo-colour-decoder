Ever wonder why your stool color changes after eating certain foods or taking medicine? It’s actually a colorful adventure happening inside your digestive system! The color of your stool mainly comes from bile—a greenish fluid made by your liver—and the way it breaks down as it travels through your intestines. Foods like beets can turn your stool reddish, while spinach might give it a greener hue. Certain medications or supplements, like iron pills or Pepto-Bismol, can also paint your stool black or even green. These changes are usually harmless and simply reflect what you’ve recently consumed or taken. Think of your stool as a little daily art project, showcasing your body’s unique mix of diet and digestion!
