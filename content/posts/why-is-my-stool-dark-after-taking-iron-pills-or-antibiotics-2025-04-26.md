Did you know that taking iron pills or certain antibiotics can turn your stool dark, sometimes almost black? This color change is actually quite common and happens because iron supplements introduce extra iron into your digestive system. When iron mixes with digestive fluids, it creates a darker pigment, giving your stool a deep, sometimes tar-like appearance. Similarly, some antibiotics can alter your gut bacteria or interact with meals, which might also affect stool color. It’s a harmless side effect showing how what you swallow can directly influence what comes out! So next time your stool looks like a midnight snack after popping those pills, it’s just your body’s colorful response to your treatment journey. Pretty cool, right?
