**PoopColor Decoder** was born out of one simple fact: stool colour can tell you a lot about your diet, hydration and gut health—yet most resources are dry, medical-only sites.

On this site you can:

- **Instantly** analyse your stool colour in your browser (no uploads, 100 % private).  
- Read bite-sized “Daily Poo Facts” to learn what different shades might mean.  
- Posts about common questions like “Why is my poo green?” or “What does yellow stool mean?”

Our goal is to make gut-health fun, informative, and accessible. Enjoy responsibly—and remember, this is for **entertainment & educational purposes only**, not medical advice.
