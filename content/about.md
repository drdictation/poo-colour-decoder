## Our Mission

I started PoopColor.info with a simple goal: to provide clear, accurate, and accessible information about one of the most important indicators of our overall healthâ€”our stool. I believe that understanding the 'why' behind symptoms empowers people to make better health decisions and have more informed conversations with their doctors.

This site translates complex medical knowledge into easy-to-understand articles and tools, all grounded in scientific evidence and clinical experience.
